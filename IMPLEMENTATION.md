# VRCX macOS Build Implementation Summary

This implementation adds complete macOS build support for the Electron version of VRCX based on the community solution from [vrcx-team/VRCX#1117](https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX/issues/1117).

## What's New

### Build Infrastructure
- **Complete macOS build support** with x64 architecture (Apple Silicon compatible via Rosetta 2)
- **Automated build script** (`build-scripts/build-macos.sh`) that handles the entire build process
- **Test validation script** (`build-scripts/test-macos-setup.sh`) to verify setup before building
- **npm scripts** for easy building: `npm run build-macos` and `npm run test-macos-setup`

### Core Changes
- **DOTNET_ROOT handling**: Automatically sets the correct path for x64 .NET SDK on macOS
- **Platform detection**: Properly identifies macOS and adjusts behavior accordingly
- **SQLite support**: Uses existing macOS SQLite.Interop.dll for database operations
- **Version strings**: Shows "VRCX (macOS)" instead of "VRCX (Linux)" on macOS

### Configuration
- **Electron-builder config**: Added macOS target with proper app bundle settings
- **Build scripts**: Multiple build options from quick automated builds to manual step-by-step
- **Documentation**: Complete `README.macOS.md` with prerequisites and instructions

## How to Use

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - .NET 9.0 SDK (x64 version) - `/usr/local/share/dotnet/x64/`
   - Node.js 18+
   - Xcode Command Line Tools

2. **Test Setup**:
   ```bash
   npm run test-macos-setup
   ```

3. **Build VRCX**:
   ```bash
   npm run build-macos
   ```

4. **Run VRCX**:
   ```bash
   open build/mac/VRCX.app
   ```

## Key Features

- **x64 only**: Supports Intel Macs natively, Apple Silicon via Rosetta 2
- **Self-contained**: Includes all necessary SQLite libraries
- **Automated**: Single command builds everything
- **Tested**: Comprehensive validation ensures everything works
- **Compatible**: Works with existing VRCX codebase without breaking changes

## Architecture

The implementation follows the exact solution provided in the GitHub issue:
- Uses x64 .NET SDK on macOS
- Sets `DOTNET_ROOT` environment variable correctly
- Builds with `prod-linux` target (Linux/Unix-like behavior)
- Uses electron-builder for app bundle creation
- Includes proper code signing (ad-hoc by default)

## Result

Users can now build VRCX for macOS with a single command, creating a fully functional macOS app bundle that runs natively on Intel Macs and through Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon Macs.
