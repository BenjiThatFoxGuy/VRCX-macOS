# GitHub Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive GitHub workflow for building the macOS version of VRCX based on the instructions and infrastructure provided in PR #1.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. **macOS Build Job** (`build_macos`)
- **Runner**: `macos-latest`
- **Dependencies**: `set_version`
- **Environment Setup**:
  - .NET 9.0 SDK (x64 architecture)
  - Node.js 18 with npm caching
- **Build Steps**:
  1. Checkout repository
  2. Setup .NET and Node.js
  3. Set version from shared version job
  4. Install npm dependencies
  5. Run macOS setup validation test
  6. Execute macOS build using existing `build-macos.sh`
  7. Verify build output
  8. Upload .app bundle as artifact

### 2. **Workflow Integration**
- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch, push to master/main, pull requests
- **Parallel Building**: macOS builds alongside Windows and Linux
- **Dependency Chain**: All builds complete before packaging
- **Artifacts**: Dedicated macOS app bundle and zip package

### 3. **Enhanced Features**
- **Error Handling**: Build verification and conditional steps
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive workflow documentation
- **Code Signing**: Support for developer certificates (configurable)
- **Caching**: npm cache for faster builds

### 4. **Output Artifacts**
- `VRCX-macOS`: Raw .app bundle
- `VRCX-macOS-Zip`: Distributable zip package

## Technical Requirements Met
- ✅ Uses macOS runner environment
- ✅ Installs .NET 9.0 SDK (x64 architecture)
- ✅ Installs Node.js 18+
- ✅ Leverages existing build infrastructure from PR #1
- ✅ Integrates with existing workflow structure
- ✅ Creates distributable artifacts
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Includes comprehensive testing

## Testing Results
- ✅ macOS setup validation passes completely
- ✅ YAML syntax validation passes
- ✅ Build scripts are executable and properly configured
- ✅ npm scripts function correctly
- ✅ Production build completes successfully
- ✅ All required files and configurations are in place

## Usage
The workflow will automatically:
1. Build macOS version when triggered
2. Create distributable .app bundle
3. Package as zip for distribution
4. Upload as GitHub Actions artifacts

## Ready for Production
The implementation is complete and ready for production use. The workflow will build macOS versions of VRCX alongside Windows and Linux versions using the battle-tested infrastructure from PR #1.
